# dotfiles
you should only use these to understand more about something. you shouldn't just piggy back on someone's dotfiles because you will never do it yourself. at least try to customize some things even if you want to use mine. you are always welcome to use these though i don't recommend it.

- and yes, this is a fork of (https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice) Luke's voidrice. I'm going to change almost the entire system though. The only reason it is is because I needed an easily usable system quickly for some reason. I've just stuck with it since and changed it to suit me.
